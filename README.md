Project Donut üç©
================

```npm run dev``` will run typescript compiler and server to allow development

*Donut* is currently an OOP typescript framework with an onion server design that attemptss to follow a "clean architecture" standard and SOLID principles.
The destination and vision of *Donut* is to eventually become a framework agnostic piece of tech that can be plugged into any node or deno technologies with minimum config and allow a uniform OOP dev approach to both legacy systems, and future tech
